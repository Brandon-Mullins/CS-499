# Enhancement 3: Databases

# Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

The artifact used for this enhancement is the Weight Tracker Android application originally created during my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. In its original form, the application allowed users to add, update, and delete weight entries during active use of the app. However, the data was stored only locally in memory, meaning long-term persistence and recovery were limited.

For this enhancement, the application was expanded to include a database-backed history and backup system. All weight entries are now stored persistently using a structured database, ensuring that user data is retained across sessions and protected from accidental loss. This enhancement transforms the application from a temporary tracking tool into a reliable long-term health record system.

# Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this artifact because it clearly demonstrates my ability to design and integrate database solutions into a real application. Data persistence is a critical requirement for nearly all production software, and this enhancement shows how database concepts directly support usability, reliability, and user trust.

This enhancement showcases my ability to:

Design and structure persistent data storage

Implement database schemas aligned with application needs

Perform safe create, read, update, and delete operations

Separate database logic from UI components

Maintain data integrity across application restarts

The artifact was improved by introducing a history backup feature that ensures all weight records are saved and retrievable at any time. Users no longer lose progress when the application closes or the device restarts, making the app suitable for long-term use. This enhancement significantly increases the realism and professionalism of the application.

# Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, this enhancement meets the database-related course outcomes identified in Module One. It demonstrates my ability to use well-founded tools and techniques to implement persistent storage solutions that deliver real value to users.

With this enhancement completed, I have now demonstrated progress across all three core areas of the Computer Science program: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. At this stage, my remaining focus is on refining documentation, presentation, and overall polish for the final ePortfolio submission.

# Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

Through this enhancement, I gained a deeper understanding of how essential databases are to modern software systems. One of the primary challenges was designing a data structure that could support future growth while remaining simple and efficient for current needs.

Another challenge involved ensuring that database operations were synchronized correctly with the application’s existing logic. Handling edge cases such as empty histories, deleted entries, and updated values required careful planning and testing. This process encouraged me to think beyond basic functionality and consider reliability, consistency, and long-term maintainability.

Overall, this enhancement reinforced the importance of databases as the foundation of trustworthy applications and strengthened my ability to build systems that users can depend on over time.
