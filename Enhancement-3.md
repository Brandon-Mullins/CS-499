Module Five: Enhancement 3

Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I selected for my database enhancement is the History Backup feature added to my Weight Tracker Android application that was originally created during my CS 360 coursework. The original version of the app focused on allowing users to add, update, and delete weight entries using local storage. While the data was functional during active use, the app lacked a long-term persistence or backup mechanism.
For this enhancement, I added a structured database-backed history system that allows all weight records to be stored persistently and safely. This ensures that the user’s data is retained across sessions and protected from accidental loss, turning the app into a more reliable long-term tracking system.
Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with real database systems and apply data persistence techniques to a mobile application. Without a database, even well-designed applications risk losing their usefulness over time. Adding the history backup feature makes the application far more realistic and production-ready.
This enhancement showcases my ability to:
– Design database schemas
– Implement structured data storage
– Connect the app’s UI to persistent records
– Safely read and write records
– Maintain clean separation between the UI and data layer
– Preserve historical records across sessions
The improvement transformed the application from a temporary tracking tool into a reliable health history system. Users no longer lose progress when the app closes or the device restarts, which is critical for any real-world health tracking software.
Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
Yes, this enhancement directly meets the database course outcome that I planned to address in Module One. I was able to demonstrate my ability to use well-founded tools and techniques for building a real database-backed application. The history backup feature also reinforces the outcome regarding delivering computing solutions that provide real value to users.
With all three enhancements now completed, I have demonstrated progress across software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. At this point, my focus will be on polishing these enhancements for the final ePortfolio and ensuring everything is clearly presented and documented.
Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
Through this enhancement, I learned how important data persistence and reliability are in real applications. One of the biggest challenges was deciding how to structure the stored data so that it could be accessed efficiently and remain flexible for future expansion. I also had to ensure the database interactions were properly synchronized with the app’s existing UI logic.
Another challenge was testing edge cases, such as empty histories, deleted records, and updated values. This forced me to think more like a production developer rather than just focusing on functionality. This enhancement helped strengthen my understanding of how databases serve as the foundation for modern applications and reinforced my ability to build software that users can trust long term.
