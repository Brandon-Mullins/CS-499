# Brandon Mullins — CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio for CS-499 at Southern New Hampshire University.  
This portfolio represents the culmination of my undergraduate work and highlights my growth across software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Throughout the program, I focused on building practical, maintainable, and user-focused software solutions. The artifacts presented here demonstrate my ability to design complete systems, apply algorithmic thinking, work with persistent data storage, and communicate technical decisions clearly and professionally.

## Portfolio Overview

This ePortfolio contains one primary application artifact that was enhanced across three core computer science domains, along with a code review and a professional self-assessment.

Each section below links to a detailed narrative explaining the enhancement, the skills demonstrated, and how the work aligns with program outcomes.

## Artifact Summary

**Primary Artifact:** Weight Tracker Android Application  
**Originally Developed In:** CS 360 – Mobile Architecture and Programming  
**Technologies Used:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android Architecture Components, Local Data Persistence  

The Weight Tracker application evolved from a basic mobile app into a fully enhanced system through iterative improvements across all three required categories. Each enhancement builds upon the previous one to demonstrate real-world software development practices.
