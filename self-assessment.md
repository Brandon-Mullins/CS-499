# Professional Self-assessment
	
Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has allowed me to clearly see how my technical skills, problem-solving ability, and professional mindset have evolved. When I began the program, my focus was primarily on learning syntax and understanding how individual programs worked. As I progressed through the coursework and ultimately through the capstone experience, my thinking shifted toward designing complete systems that are maintainable, scalable, and meaningful to real users.

Throughout the program, I developed strong foundations in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Courses such as CS 360, CS 340, CS 320, and CS 260 helped me understand how modern applications are built end to end, from user interfaces to data persistence and logic processing. The Weight Tracker application included in this ePortfolio demonstrates this progression by showing how an initial application can be refined through iterative enhancements that improve usability, performance, and data reliability.

Collaboration and communication were emphasized throughout the program, even in courses that were individually focused. Discussion boards, peer feedback, and instructor reviews helped reinforce the importance of explaining technical decisions clearly and respectfully. The code review milestone in this capstone course reinforced how valuable structured feedback is in improving software quality and supporting decision making among stakeholders. Learning how to communicate technical concepts to non-technical audiences has been especially important, as it reflects real workplace expectations.

My work with algorithms and data structures strengthened my ability to evaluate and solve problems efficiently. Through the second enhancement of my artifact, I applied structured logic to group and analyze data across time periods, allowing the application to provide meaningful insights rather than simply storing information. This experience reinforced the importance of selecting appropriate data structures and balancing performance with readability and maintainability.
Software engineering principles are demonstrated throughout my artifact enhancements. Using modern Android development practices such as Jetpack Compose, ViewModels, and modular UI design helped me create code that is easier to test, maintain, and extend. Iterative refinement based on instructor feedback taught me how professional software evolves over time rather than being completed in a single pass.

Database concepts played a critical role in my final enhancement. Implementing data persistence and backup functionality reinforced the importance of data integrity, reliability, and user trust. This work highlighted how databases are not just storage mechanisms, but essential components that support application stability and long-term usability.
Security awareness has been an ongoing theme across the program. While my project is not security-heavy, considerations such as permission handling, data validation, and responsible data storage reflect a developing security mindset. I now approach development with greater awareness of how design decisions can introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully considered.

Together, the artifacts in this ePortfolio demonstrate my growth from a student learning programming fundamentals to an emerging computer science professional capable of designing, evaluating, and refining complete software solutions. This portfolio represents not only the technical skills I have developed, but also my readiness to enter the field with a mindset focused on quality, adaptability, and continuous improvement.
