# Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering
 
# Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I selected for this enhancement is my Android Weight Tracker App from CS 360. The app allows users to log their weight, update entries, set goals, and view their progress over time. The original version focused on basic CRUD operations and user login features, and it was created during my mobile development course. For the capstone, I am enhancing this same app to showcase skills in different areas of computer science.

# Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components showcase your skills in algorithms and data structures? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this artifact because it is a strong foundation for demonstrating algorithmic thinking and practical data processing. It works with lists of weight entries, dates, and user input, which makes it a good candidate for adding meaningful computational logic.
For this milestone, I added a productive weight trend feature that calculates weekly averages and detects whether the user is moving toward or away from their goal. This enhancement required building functions to sort data, group entries by date, compute averages, and evaluate trends using rate-of-change logic. The improvement shows that I can design and implement algorithms that operate on real user data and integrate them into an interactive application.

# Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
Yes, this enhancement allowed me to meet the course outcome focused on designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles. I implemented logic that transforms raw data into meaningful insights, and I applied practices related to data structures, sorting, and filtering collections.
I am still on track with my outcome-coverage plan. This milestone covers the Algorithms and Data Structures category, while the next milestone will complete the Databases category.

# Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
While implementing the productive weight trend feature, I learned how important it is to structure data in a way that supports algorithmic processing. One challenge was correctly grouping weight entries by week, especially since users may log multiple entries on different days. Another challenge was designing a clean way to calculate averages and detect progress without making the UI code overly complicated. Solving these issues helped me improve my ability to write modular functions, separate logic from the interface, and apply data-processing techniques that scale as the app grows.
